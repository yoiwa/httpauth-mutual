    <abstract>
      <t>
   This document specifies a few extensions of HTTP authentication
   framework for interactive clients.  Recently, 
   fundamental features of HTTP-level authentication is not enough for
   complex requirements of various Web-based applications.  This makes
   these applications to implement their own authentication frameworks
   using HTML Forms and other means, which becomes one of the hurdles
   against introducing secure authentication mechanisms handled jointly by
   servers and user-agent clients.
   The extended framework fills gaps between Web application requirements and
   HTTP authentication provisions to solve the above problems, while maintaining
   compatibility against existing Web and non-Web uses of HTTP authentications.

<section title="Introduction">

     <t>
        The document proposes several extensions to the current
        HTTP authentication framework, to provide enough functionality
        comparable with current widely-used
        form-based Web authentication.  A majority of the recent Web-sites
        on the Internet use custom application-layer
        authentication implementations using Web forms.  The reasons for
        these may vary, but many people believe that the current HTTP
        Basic (and Digest, too) authentication method does not have
        enough functionality (including a good-feeling user interfaces)
        to support most of realistic Web-based applications.
        However, the method is very weak against phishing and other attacks, 
        because the whole behavior of the authentication is controlled
        from the server-side applications.  This makes it really hard to
        implement any cryptographically strong authentication mechanisms
        into Web systems. To overcome this problem, we need to
        "modernize" the HTTP authentication framework so that better
        client-controlled secure methods can be used with Web applications.

        The extensions proposed in this document include:
        <list style="symbols">
	  <t>non-mandatory, optional authentication on HTTP (<xref target="optional-auth" />),</t>
	  <t>log out from both server and client side (<xref target="auth-control-header" />), and</t>
	  <t>finer control for redirection depending on authentication status (<xref target="auth-control-header" />).</t>
      </list>
     </t>

  <section title="Terminology">

    <t>The key words "&MUST;", "&MUST_NOT;", "&REQUIRED;", "&SHALL;", "&SHALL_NOT;",
        "&SHOULD;", "&SHOULD_NOT;", "&RECOMMENDED;", "&NOT_RECOMMENDED;", "&MAY;", and
        "&OPTIONAL;" in this document are to be interpreted as described
        in <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>

    <t>The terms "encouraged" and "advised" are used for suggestions that
       do not constitute "&SHOULD;"-level requirements.  People &MAY;
       freely choose not to include the suggested items regarding
       <xref target="RFC2119" />, but complying with those suggestions would be
       a best practice; it will improve the security, interoperability, and/or
       operational performance.</t>

    <t>This document distinguishes the terms "client" and "user" in the following way:
       A "client" is an entity understanding and talking HTTP and the specified authentication protocol,
       usually computer software; a "user" is a (usually natural) person
       who wants to access data resources using "a client".</t>

    <!-- t>See <xref target="RFC4949" /> for security-related terms -->

    <!-- t>The term "natural numbers" refers to the non-negative integers (including zero) throughout this document.</t -->

<section anchor="definitions" title="Definitions">

<section anchor="state term definitions" title="Terms for describing authentication protocol flow">
<t>
HTTP Authentication defined in <xref target="RFC7235" /> may involve with
several pairs of HTTP requests/responses.
Throughout this document, the following terms are used to categorize those messages: for requests,
<list style="symbols">
<t>A non-authenticating request is a request not attempting any authentication: a request without any &_Authorization; header.
</t>
<t>An authenticating request is the opposite: a request with an &_Authorization; header.
</t>
</list>
For responses,
<list style="hanging" hangIndent="3">
<t hangText="1) A non-authenticated response:"> is a response which does not involve
with any HTTP authentication.  It may not contain any
&_WWW-Authenticate; or &_Authentication-Info; header.
</t>
<t>
Servers send this response when the requested resource is not
protected by HTTP authentication mechanisms.  In context of this
specification, not-authentication-related negative responses (e.g. 403
and 404) are also considered as non-authenticated responses.
</t>

<t>(See note on successfully-authenticated responses below for some ambiguous cases.)</t>

<t hangText="2) An authentication-initializing response:">
is a response which requires or allows clients to start authentication
attempts. Servers send this response when the requested resource is
protected by HTTP authentication mechanism, and the request meets
one of the following cases:

<list style="symbols">
<t> The request is non-authenticating request, or</t>
<t> The request contained an authentication trial directed to
    the protection space (realm) other than the server's expected one.</t>
</list>

The server will specify the protection space for authentication in this response.
</t>

<t>Upon reception, the client's behavior is further divided to two possible
cases.
<list style="symbols">
<t>If the client may have no prior knowledge on authentication
credentials (e.g. a user-name and a password) related to the requested
protection space, the protocol flow terminates and the client will
ask the user to provide authentication credentials,</t>
<t>On the other hand, if client already have an enough credentials for
authentication to the requested protection space, the client
will automatically send an authenticating request.
Such cases often occur when the client did not know beforehand that
the current request-URL requires an authentication.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t hangText="3) A successfully-authenticated response:">
is a response for an authenticating request meaning that the
authentication attempt was granted.  (Note: if the authentication
scheme used does not use an &_Authentication-Info; header, it may be
indistinguishable from a non-authenticated response.)
</t>

<t hangText="4) An intermediate authenticating response:">
is a response for an
authenticating request which requires some more reaction by the client
software without involving users.  Such a response is required when an
authentication scheme requires two or more round-trip messages to
perform authentication, or when an authentication scheme uses some
speculative short-cut method (such as uses of cached shared secrets)
and it failed.
</t>
<t hangText="5) A negatively-authenticated response:">
is a response for an authenticating request which means that the
authentication attempt was declined and can not continue without
another authentication credential.  
Clients typically erase memory of the currently-using credentials
and ask the user for other ones.
</t>
<t>
Usually the format of these responses are as same as the one for
authentication-initializing responses.  Client can distinguish it by
comparing the protection spaces contained in the request and in the
response.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<xref target="figure-client-dia" /> shows a state diagram of generic HTTP authentication with the above message categorization.
Note that many authentication schemes use only a subset of the transitions described on the diagram.
Labels in the figure show the abbreviated names of response types.

<section anchor="syntax-notation" title="Syntax Notation">
<t>
This specification uses an extended BNF syntax defined in <xref target="RFC7230" />.  The following syntax definitions are quoted from <xref target="RFC7230" /> and <xref target="RFC7235" />: auth-scheme, quoted-string, auth-param, SP, BWS, header-field, and challenge.  It also uses the convention of using header names for specifying syntax of header values.
</t>
<t>
Additionally, this specification uses the following syntax elements
following syntax definitions as a refinement for token and the right-hand-side of auth-param in <xref target="RFC7235" />. (Note: these definitions are consistent with those in <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpauth-mutual" />.)
</t>
<figure anchor="figure-auth-common-syntax" title="the BNF syntax for common notations">
<artwork type="abnf">
 bare-token        = 1*(%x30-39 / %x41-5A / %x61-7A / "-" / "_")

 extensive-token   = bare-token / extension-token
 integer           = "0" / (%x31-39 *%x30-39)      ; no leading zeros
</artwork>
</figure>
<t>
Extensive-tokens are used in this protocol where the set of acceptable tokens may
include private extensions.  Any private extensions of this protocol &MUST; use the
extension-tokens with format "-&lt;token&gt;.&lt;domain&nbhy;name&gt;", where &lt;domain-name&gt; is
a validly registered (sub-)domain name on the Internet owned by the
party who defines the extensions.

<section anchor="optional-auth" title="Optional Authentication">

<t>
The &_Optional-WWW-Authenticate; header enables a non-mandatory authentication,
which is not possible under the current HTTP authentication mechanism.
In several Web applications, users can access the same contents as
both a guest user and an authenticated user.  In most Web applications,
it is implemented using <xref target="RFC6265">HTTP cookies</xref> and custom form-based authentications.
The new authentication method using this message will provide a replacement for
these authentication systems.
</t>

<t>
Servers &MAY; send HTTP successful responses (response code 200, 206 and
others) containing the &_Optional-WWW-Authenticate; header as a replacement
of a 401 response when it is an authentication-initializing response.
The &_Optional-WWW-Authenticate; header &MUST_NOT; be contained in 401 responses.
</t>

<t>
<list style="empty">
<t>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK<vspace blankLines="0" />

<artwork type="abnf2616">
 Optional-WWW-Authenticate = 1#challenge
</artwork>
</figure>

<t>
The challenges contained in the &_Optional-WWW-Authenticate; header are the same as
those for a 401 responses corresponding for a same request.
For authentication-related matters, an optional authentication request will have the same meaning
as a 401 message with a corresponding &_WWW-Authenticate; header (as an authentication-initializing response).
(The behavior for other matters, such as caching, &MAY; be different between
the optional authentication and 401 messages.)
</t>

<t>
A response with an &_Optional-WWW-Authenticate; header &SHOULD; be
returned from the server only when the request is either non-authenticated
or authenticating to a wrong (not the server's expected) protection space.
If a response is either an intermediate or a negative response 
to a client's authentication attempt, the server &MUST; respond
with a 401 status response with a &_WWW-Authenticate; header instead.
Failure to comply this rule will make client not able to distinguish
authentication successes and failures.
</t>

<t>
The server is &NOT_RECOMMENDED; to include an &_Optional-WWW-Authenticate; header
in a positive response when a client's authentication attempt succeeds.
</t>

<t>
Whenever an authentication scheme support for servers to send some
parameter which gives a hint of URL space for the corresponding
protection space for the same realm (e.g. "path" or "domain"), servers
requesting non-mandatory authentication &SHOULD; send such parameter
with the response.  Clients supporting non-mandatory authentication
&MUST; recognize the parameter, and &MUST; send a request with an
appropriate authentication credential in an &_Authorization; header
for any URI inside the specified paths.
</t>

<t>
Support of this header is &OPTIONAL;; Clients &MAY; also choose any
set of authentication schemes for which optional authentication is
supported (in other words, its support &MAY; be scheme-dependent).
However, some authentication schemes &MAY; require
mandatory/recommended support for this header, so that server-side
applications &MAY; assume that clients supporting such schemes are
likely to support the extension as well.
</t>

</figure>

<t>
The &_Authentication-Control; header provides a more precise control of the
client behavior for Web applications using an HTTP authentication protocol.
This header is supposed to be generated in the application layer, as opposed to
&_WWW-Authenticate; headers which will be generated usually by the Web servers.
</t>

<t>
Support of this header is &OPTIONAL;, and clients &MAY; choose any
subset of these parameters to be supported.  The set of supported
parameters &MAY; also be authentication scheme-dependent.  However,
some authentication schemes &MAY; require mandatory/recommended
support for some or all of the features provided in this header.
</t>

<t>
The &_Authentication-Control; header contains one or more "authentication control entries"
each of which corresponds to a single realm for a specific authentication scheme.
If the &_auth-scheme; specified for an entry supports the HTTP "realm" feature,
that entry &MUST; contain the "realm" parameter.
If not, the entry &MUST_NOT; contain the "realm" parameter.
</t>

<t>
Among the multiple entries in the header,
the meaningful entries in the header are those corresponding to an
&_auth-scheme; and a realm (if any), for which "the authentication
process is being performed, or going to be performed".  In more
detail,
<list style="format (%d)">
<t>
If the response is either an authentication-initializing response
or a negatively-authenticated response, there
may be multiple challenges in the WWW-Authenticate (or
Optional-WWW-Authenticate defined in this extension) header,
each of which corresponds to a different scheme and realm.
The client will determine the scheme and realm to
perform an authentication, and the entries corresponding to
the chosen scheme and realm will be meaningful.
</t>
<t>
If the response is either an intermediate authenticating response or
a successfully-authenticated response, 
the scheme and a realm given in the Authorization header of the 
HTTP request will determine the currently-ongoing authentication process.
Only the entries correspond to that scheme and realm are meaningful.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
The server &MAY; send an &_Authentication-Control; header
containing non-meaningful entries.
The client &MUST; ignore all non-meaningful entries it received.
</t>

<t>
Each entry contains one or more parameters, each of which is a
name-value pair.  The name of each parameter &MUST; be an
extensive-token.
Clients &MUST; ignore any unknown parameters contained in
this header.
The entries for the same &_auth-scheme; and the realm &MUST_NOT;
contain the duplicated parameters for the same name.
</t>

<t>
The type of parameter value depends on the
parameter name as defined in the following subsections.
Regardless of the type, however, the recipients &SHOULD; accept
both quoted and unquoted representations of values as defined in HTTP.
If the parameter is defined to have a string value,
is is encouraged t be sent either in a quoted form or an ext-value form
(see <xref target="sec-extvalue" />).
If it is defined as a token (or similar) or an integer,
the value &SHOULD; follow the corresponding ABNF syntax after possible
unquoting of the quoted-string value (as defined in HTTP), and
is encouraged to be sent in a unquoted form.
</t>

<t>
Server-side application &SHOULD; always be reminded that any
parameters contained in this header &MAY; be ignored by clients. Also,
even when a client accepts this header, users may always be able to
circumvent semantics of this header.  Therefore, if this header is
used for security purposes, its use &MUST; be limited for providing
some non-fundamental additional security measures valuable for
end-users (such as client-side log-out for protecting against console
takeover).  Server-side application &MUST_NOT; rely on the use of this
header for protecting server-side resources.
</t>

<t>
Note: The header syntax allows servers to specify Authentication-Control for
multiple authentication schemes, either as multiple occurrences of
this header or as a combined single header (see Section 3.2.2 of <xref target="RFC7230" /> for rationale).
The same care as for parsing multiple authentication challenges &SHALL; be taken.
</t>

<section title="Non-ASCII extended header parameters" anchor="sec-extvalue">
<t>
Parameters contained in the Authentication-Control header
&MAY; be extended to ISO 10646-1 values using the framework described in <xref target="RFC5987" />.
All servers and clients &MUST; be capable of receiving and sending values encoded in
<xref target="RFC5987" /> syntax.
</t>
<t>
If a value to be sent contains only ASCII characters, the field &MUST; be sent
in clear using plain RFC 7235 syntax. The syntax extended by RFC 5987 &MUST_NOT; be used in this case.
</t>
<t>
If a value (except the "realm" header) 
contains one or more non-ASCII characters, the parameter &SHOULD; be sent
using the ext-value syntax defined in Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC5987" />.
Such parameter &MUST; have charset value of "UTF-8", and the
language value &MUST; always be omitted (have an empty value).
The same parameter &MUST_NOT; be sent twice or more,
those in both plain- and extended-syntax.
</t>
<t>
For example, a parameter "username" with value "Renee or France" &SHOULD; be sent as
&lt; username="Renee of France" &gt;.  If the value is "Ren&lt;e acute&gt;e of France", it &SHOULD; be
sent as &lt; username*=UTF-8''Ren%C3%89e%20of%20France &gt; instead.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Auth-style parameter" anchor="auth-control-auth-style">
<t>
&_Authentication-Control;: Digest realm="protected space",<vspace />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; auth-style=modal
</t>

<t>
The parameter "auth-style" specifies the server's preferences over
user interface behavior for user authentication.
This parameter can be included in any kind of responses, however, it
is only meaningful for either authentication-initializing or
negatively-authenticated responses.
The value of this parameter &MUST; be one of the bare-tokens "modal" or "non-modal".
When the &_Optional-WWW-Authenticate; header is used, the value of
this parameter &MUST; be disregarded and the value "non-modal" is
implied.
</t>

<t>
The value "modal" means that the server thinks the content of the
response (body and other content-related headers) is valuable only for
users refusing authentication request.  The clients are expected
to ask the user a password before processing the content.  This behavior
is common for most of the current implementations of Basic and Digest authentication schemes.
</t>

<t>
The value "non-modal" means that the server thinks the content of the
response (body and other content-related headers) is valuable for
users before processing an authentication request.
The clients are expected to first process the content 
and then provide users opportunities to perform authentication.
</t>

<t>
The default behavior for the clients is implementation-dependent, and
clients &MAY; choose different defaults for different authentication schemes.
The proposed default behavior is "modal" for all authentication schemes,
but specifications for authentication schemes &MAY; propose a different default.
</t>

<t>
The above two different methods of authentication may introduce a
observable difference of semantics when the response contains
state-changing side effects; for example, it may change whether <xref
target="RFC6265">Cookie headers</xref> in 401 responses are processed
or not.  However, the server applications &SHOULD_NOT; depend on both
existence and non-existence of such side effects.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Location-when-unauthenticated parameter" anchor="auth-control-loc-unauth">
<t>
&_Authentication-Control;: Mutual realm="auth-space-1",<vspace />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &_location-when-unauthenticated;="http://www.example.com/login.html"
</t>

<t>
The parameter "&_location-when-unauthenticated;" specifies a location where
any unauthenticated clients should be redirected to.
This header may be used, for example, when there is a central login page
for the entire Web application.
The value of this parameter is a string that contains an absolute URL location.
Senders &MUST; always send an absolute URL location.
If a received URL is not absolute, the clients &SHOULD; either ignore it or
consider it a relative URL from the current location.
</t>
<t>
This parameter &MAY; be used with a 401 response for authentication-initializing response.
It can also be contained, although &NOT_RECOMMENDED;, in a positive response
with an &_Optional-WWW-Authenticate; header.
The clients &MUST; ignore this parameter, when a response is either
successfully-authenticated or intermediately-authenticated.
The clients &SHOULD; ignore this parameter when a response
is a negatively-authenticated one (the case is unlikely to happen, though).
</t>
<t>
When a client receives an authentication-initiating response
with this parameter, if the
client has to ask users for authentication credentials,
the client will treat the entire response
as if it were a 303 "See Other" response with a Location header that
contains the value of this parameter (i.e., client will be redirected
to the specified location with a GET request).  Unlike a normal 303
response, if the client can process authentication without the user's
interaction, this parameter &MUST; be ignored.
</t>
<!-- t>
If the specified location 
The specified location &SHOULD; be included in a set of locations specified
in the "&_auth-domain;" parameter of the corresponding &_401-B0; message. If this 
is not satisfied, the clients &MAY; ignore this parameter.
</t -->
</section>

<section title="No-auth parameter" anchor="auth-control-no-auth">
<t>
&_Authentication-Control;: Basic realm="entrance", no-auth=true
</t>

<t>
The parameter "no-auth" is a variant of the
&_location-when-unauthenticated; parameter; it specifies that new
authentication attempt is not to be performed on this location for
better user experience, without specifying the redirection on the HTTP
level.  This header may be used, for example, when there is a central
login page for the entire Web application, and when a (Web content's
level) explicit interaction of users is desired before
authentications.  The value of this parameter &MUST; be a token
"true".  If the value is incorrect, client &MAY; ignore this
parameter.
</t>
<t>
This parameter &MAY; be used with authentication-initiating responses.
It can also be contained, although &NOT_RECOMMENDED;, in a positive response
with an &_Optional-WWW-Authenticate; header.
The clients &MUST; ignore this parameter, when a response is either
successfully-authenticated or intermediately-authenticated.
The clients &SHOULD; ignore this parameter when a response
is a negatively-authenticated one (the case is unlikely to happen, though).
</t>
<t>
When a client receives an authentication-initiating 
response with this parameter, if the
client has to ask users for authentication credentials,
the client will ignore the &_WWW-Authenticate; header contained in the
response and treat the whole response as a normal negative 4xx-class
response instead of giving user an opportunity to start
authentication. If the client can process authentication without the
user's interaction, this parameter &MUST; ignored.
</t>
<t>
This parameter &SHOULD_NOT; be used along with the &_location-when-unauthenticated; parameter.
If both were supplied, clients &MAY; choose which one is to be honored.
</t>
<t>
This parameter &SHOULD_NOT; be used as any security measures to
prevent authentication attempts, as it is easily circumvented by
users.  This parameter &SHOULD; be used solely for improving user
experience of web applications.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Location-when-logout parameter" anchor="auth-control-loc-logout">
<t>
&_Authentication-Control;: Digest realm="protected space",<vspace />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &_location-when-logout;="http://www.example.com/byebye.html"
</t>

<t>
The parameter "&_location-when-logout;" specifies a location where
the client is to be redirected when the user explicitly request a logout.
The value of this parameter &MUST; be a string that contains an absolute URL location.
If a given URL is not absolute, the clients &MAY; consider it a relative URL
from the current location.
</t>
<t>
This parameter &MAY; be used with successfully-authenticated
responses.  If this parameter is contained in other kinds of
responses, the clients &MUST; ignore this parameter.
</t>
<t>
When the user requests to terminate an authentication period, and if
the client currently displays a page supplied by a response with this
parameter, the client will be redirected to the specified location by
a new GET request (as if it received a 303 response).  The log-out
operation (e.g. erasing memories of user name, authentication
credential and all related one-time credentials such as nonce or keys)
&SHOULD; occur before processing a redirection.
</t>
<t>
When the user requests to terminate an authentication period, if the
client supports this parameter but the server response does not
contain this parameter, the client's &RECOMMENDED; behavior is as
follows: if the request corresponding to the current content was
safe (e.g. GET), reload the page without the authentication
credential.  If the request was non-idempotent (e.g. POST), keep the
current content as-is and simply forget the authentication status.
The client &SHOULD_NOT; replay a non-idempotent request without the
user's explicit approval.
</t>
<t>
Web applications are encouraged to send this parameter
with an appropriate value for any responses (except those with
redirection (3XX) statuses) for non-GET requests.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Logout-timeout parameter" anchor="auth-control-logout-timeout">
<t>
&_Authentication-Control;: Basic realm="entrance", &_logout-timeout;=300
</t>

<t>
The parameter "&_logout-timeout;", when contained in a
successfully-authenticated response, means that any authentication
credentials and states related to the current protection space are to
be discarded if a time specified in this header (in seconds) has been
passed from the time received.  The value &MUST; be an integer.
As a special case, the value 0 means that the client is requested to immediately
log-out from the current authentication space and revert to an
unauthenticated status.  This does not, however, mean that the
long-term memories for the passwords (such as the password reminders
and auto fill-ins) should be removed.  If a new timeout value is
received for the same authentication space, it cancels the previous
timeout and sets a new timeout.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Username parameter" anchor="auth-control-user">
<t>
&_Authentication-Control;: Basic realm="configuration", username="admin"
</t>

<t>
The parameter "username" tells that the only "user name" to be accepted
by the server is the value given in this parameter.
This parameter is particularly useful, for example, for
routers and other appliances with a Web configuration interface.
</t>
<t>
This parameter &MAY; be used with authentication-initiating responses or
negatively-authenticated responses requiring another attempt of authentication.
The clients &MUST; ignore this parameter, when a response is either
successfully-authenticated or intermediately-authenticated.
</t>
<t>
If the authentication scheme to be used has syntax limitation on the allowed
user names (e.g. Basic and Digest do not allow colons in user names), the
specified value &MUST; follow that limitation.  Client &SHOULD; ignore
any values which do not conform to such limitations.
</t>
<t>
Clients &MAY; still send any authentication requests with
other user names, possibly in vain.
Servers are not strictly required to reject user names other than specified,
but doing it will give bad user experiences and may confuse users and clients.
</t>
<t>
If the used authentication scheme requires specific style of
text preparation for the user name (e.g., PRECIS string preparation
or Unicode normalization), the specified user name &SHOULD; follow
such requirements.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Usage examples (informative)">
<t>This section shows some examples for applying this extension to
typical Web-sites which are using Forms and cookies for managing
authentication and authorization.  The content of this section is
not normative and for illustrative purposes only.
</t>
<t>
We assume that all features described in the previous
sections are implemented in clients (Web browsers).
We also assume that browsers will have a user interface which
allows users to deactivate (log-out from) current authentication sessions.
If this assumption is not hold, texts below provides another approach with
de-authentication pages used instead of such a UI.
</t>
<t>
Without explicit notices, all settings described below are to be
applied with Authentication-Control headers, and these can be sent to
clients regardless of authentication statuses (these will be silently
ignored whenever not effective).
</t>
<section title="Example 1: a portal site">
<t>This subsection provides an example application for a site whose
structure is somewhat similar to conventional portal sites.  In
particular, most of web pages are available for guest
(unauthenticated) users, and if authentication is performed, contents
of these pages are customized for each user.  We assume the site
has the following kinds of pages currently:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Content pages.</t>
<t>Pages/mechanism for performing authentication:
<list style="symbols">
<t>There is one page which asks a user name and a password using a HTML POST form.</t>
<t>After the authentication attempt, the user will be redirected to
either the page which is previously displayed before the
authentication, or some specific page.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>A de-authentication (log-out) page.</t>
</list>
</t>
<section title="Case 1: a simple application">
<t>
When such a site does not need a specific actions upon log-in and log-out, the following simple settings can be used.
<list style="symbols">
<t>Set up an optional authentication to all pages available to guests.  Set up an Authentication-Control header with "auth-style=non-modal" setting.</t>
<t>If there are pages only available to authenticated users, Set up a mandatory authentication with "auth-style=non-modal" setting.</t>
<t>No specific pages for authentication is needed.  It will be performed automatically, directed by the above setting.</t>
<t>A de-authentication page is also not needed.  If the site will have one, put "logout-timeout=0" there.</t>
<t>For all pages for POST requests, it is advisable to have "location-when-logout=&lt;some page&gt;".</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Case 2: specific action required on log-out">
<t>
If the site needs a specific actions upon log-out, the following settings can be used.
<list style="symbols">
<t>All shown in the Case 1 are to be applied.</t>
<t>For all pages, set up the Authentication-Control header "location-when-logout=&lt;de-authentication page&gt;".</t>
<t>In de-authentication pages, no specific set-up is needed.  If there is any direct links to it, put "logout-timeout=0".</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Case 3: specific page displayed before log-in">
<t>
If the site needs to display a specific page before log-in actions (some announces, user notices, or even advertisements), the following settings can be applied.
<list style="symbols">
<t>Set up an optional authentication to all pages available to guest.  Set up an Authentication-Control header with "no-auth=true".  Put a link to a specific log-in page in contents.</t>
<t>If there are pages only available to authenticated users, Set up a mandatory authentication with "location-when-unauthenticated=&lt;the log-in page&gt;".</t>
<t>For the specific log-in page, Set up a mandatory authentication.</t> 
<t>For all pages for POST requests, it is advisable to have "location-when-logout=&lt;some page&gt;", too.</t>
<t>De-authentication pages are not needed.  If the site will have one, put "logout-timeout=0".</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Example 2: authenticated user-only sites">
<t>
If almost all pages in the target site requires authentication (e.g., an Internet banking site),
or there are no needs to support both unauthenticated and authenticated users on the same resource,
the setting will become somewhat simple. The following are an example to realize such a site:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Set up a mandatory authentication to all pages available to authenticated.
Set up an Authentication-Control header with "auth-style=non-modal" setting.</t>
<t>Set up a handler for the 401-status which requests users to authenticate.</t>
<t>For all pages for POST requests, it is advisable to have "location-when-logout=&lt;some page&gt;", too.</t>
<t>De-authentication pages are not needed.  If the site will have one, put "logout-timeout=0" there.</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="When to use Cookies">
<t>
In the current Web sites using Form-based authentications,
<xref target="RFC6265">Cookies</xref> are used for managing both authorization and application sessions.
Using the extensions in this document, the former features will be
provided by using (extended) HTTP authentication/authorization mechanisms.
In some cases, there will be some ambiguous situations whether some functions
are authorization management or session management.  The following hints will be
helpful for deciding which features to be used.
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
If there is a need to serve multiple sessions for
a single user using multiple browsers concurrently,
use a Cookie for distinguishing between sessions for the same user.
(C.f. if there is a need to distinguish sessions in the same browser,
<xref target="W3C.REC-webstorage-20130730">HTML5 Web Storage</xref> features may be used instead of Cookies.)
</t>
<t>
If a web site is currently deploying a session time-out feature,
consider who benefits from the feature.  In most cases, the main
requirement for such feature is to protect users from their 
consoles and browsers hijacked (i.e. benefits are on the users' side).
In such cases, the time-out features provided in this extension may be used.
On the other hand, the requirements is to protect server's privilege
(e.g. when some regulations require to limit the time difference between
user's two-factor authentication and financial transaction commitment;
the requirement is strictly on the servers' side),
that should be managed on the server side using Cookies or other
session management mechanisms.
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Parallel deployment with Form/Cookie authentications">
<t>
In some transition periods, sites may need to support both
HTTP-layer and Form-based authentications.
The following example shows one way to achieve that.
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
If Cookies are used even for HTTP-authenticated users, each session
determined by Cookies should identify which authentication are used for the session.
</t>
<t>
First, set up any of the above settings for enabling HTTP-layer authentication.
</t>
<t>
For unauthenticated users, put the following things to the Web pages,
unless the client supports this extension and HTTP-level authentication.
<list style="symbols">
<t>
For non-mandatory authenticated pages, put a link to Form-based authenticated pages.
</t>
<t>
For mandatory authenticated pages, either put a link to Form-based authenticated pages,
or put a HTML-level redirection (using META element) to such pages.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
In Form-based authenticated pages, if users are not authenticated, it
may have a diversion for HTTP-level authentication by
"location-when-unauthenticated" setting.
</t>
<t>
Users are identified for authorizations and content customization by the following logic.
<list style="symbols">
<t>
First, check the result of the HTTP-level authentication.
If there is a Cookie session tied to a specific user, both ones should match.
</t>
<t>
If the user is not authenticated on the HTTP-level, use the conventional
Form-based method to determine the user.
</t>
<t>
If there is a Cookie tied to an HTTP authentication,
but there is no corresponding HTTP authentication result,
that session will be discarded (because 
it means that authentication is deactivated by the corresponding user).

      <t>Things which might be considered for future revisions:

        <list style="symbols"><t>In <xref
        target="RFC7235" />, meaning of
        WWW-Authenticate headers in non-401 responses are defined as
        "supplying credentials (or different credentials) might affect
        the response".  This clarification change leaves a way for
        using 200-status responses along with a WWW-Authenticate
        header for providing optional authentication.<vspace />
        Incorporating this possibility, however, needs more detailed
        analysis on the behavior of existing clients and intermediate
        proxies for such possibly-confusing
        responses. Optional-WWW-Authenticate is safer, at least for
        minimum backward compatibility, because clients not supporting
        this extension will consider this header as an unrecognized
        entity-header, possibly providing opportunity for silently
        falling-back to application-level authentications.  </t></list>
