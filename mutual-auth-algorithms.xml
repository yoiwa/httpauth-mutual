<section title="Introduction">

     <t>This document specifies algorithms for use with <xref
     target="I-D.ietf-httpauth-mutual">Mutual authentication protocol
     for Hyper-Text Transport Protocol (HTTP)</xref> (referred as the "core specification" hereafter).
     The algorithms are based on "Augmented Password-based
     Authenticated Key Exchange" (Augmented PAKE) techniques.
     In particular, 
     it uses one of three key exchange algorithms defined in 
     <xref target="ISO.11770-4.2006">ISO 11770-4: "Key management - Mechanisms based on weak secrets"</xref>
     as its basis.
     </t>

     <t>
       In very brief summary, Mutual authentication protocol
       exchanges four values, &_K_c1;, &_K_s1;, &_VK_c; and &_VK_s;, to
       perform authenticated key exchanges, using the
       password-derived secret pi and its "augmented version" J(pi).
       This document defines the set of functions &_K_c1;, &_K_s1;,
       and J for a specific algorithm family.
     </t>

     <t>
       Please note that from the view of cryptographic literature, the original
       functionality of Augmented PAKE is separated into the
       functions &_K_c1; and &_K_s1; as defined in this draft, and the
       functions &_VK_c; and &_VK_s;, which are defined in Section 11 of <xref
       target="I-D.ietf-httpauth-mutual"/> as "default functions".
       For the purpose of security analysis, please also refer to
       these functions.
     </t>

<section title="Cryptographic Overview (Non-normative)">
<t>
The cryptographic primitive used in this algorithm specification is
based on a variant of augmented PAKE proposed by T. Kwon, called APKAS-AMP, originally submitted to IEEE P1363.2.
The general flow of the successful exchange is shown below, for informative purposes only.
The multiplicative notations are used for group operators, and all modulus operations for
finite groups (mod q and mod r) are omitted.

Note that the concrete (binary) message formats (mapping to HTTP messages), as well as the formal definitions
of equations for the latter two messages, are defined in core specification <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpauth-mutual" />.
The formal definitions for values corresponding to the first two messages are defined in the following sections.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Authentication Algorithms" anchor="algorithm">

<t>
This document specifies one family of APKAS-AMP based algorithm.
This family consists of four authentication algorithms,
which differ only in their underlying mathematical groups and security
parameters.  These algorithms do not add any additional parameters.  The
tokens for these algorithms are
<list style="symbols">
 <t> &_iso-kam3-dl-2048-sha256;: for the 2048-bit discrete logarithm setting with the SHA-256 hash function.</t>
 <t> &_iso-kam3-dl-4096-sha512;: for the 4096-bit discrete logarithm setting with the SHA-512 hash function.</t>
 <t> &_iso-kam3-ec-p256-sha256;: for the 256-bit prime-field elliptic-curve setting with the SHA-256 hash function.</t>
 <t> &_iso-kam3-ec-p521-sha512;: for the 521-bit prime-field elliptic-curve setting with the SHA-512 hash function.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
For discrete logarithm settings, the underlying groups are the 2048-bit
and 4096-bit MODP groups defined in <xref target="RFC3526" />.
See <xref target="modp-groups" /> for the exact specifications of the groups
and associated parameters.
The hash functions H are SHA-256 for the
2048-bit group and SHA-512 for the 4096-bit group, respectively, defined in <xref target="FIPS.180-2.2002">FIPS PUB 180-2</xref>.
The hash iteration count nIterPi is 16384.
The representation of the parameters &_kc1;, &_ks1;, &_vkc;, and &_vks; is base64-fixed-number.
</t>

<t>
For the elliptic-curve settings, the underlying groups are the elliptic curves over the prime
fields P&nbhy;256 and P&nbhy;521, respectively, specified in the appendix&nbsp;D.1.2 of the <xref target="FIPS.186-4.2013">FIPS PUB 186-4</xref>
specification.  The hash functions H, which are referenced by the core document, are SHA-256 for the P&nbhy;256 curve and
SHA-512 for the P&nbhy;521 curve, respectively.
Cofactors of these curves are 1.
The hash iteration count nIterPi is 16384.
The representation of the parameters &_kc1;, &_ks1;, &_vkc;, and &_vks; is hex-fixed-number.
</t>

<t>
Note: This algorithm is based on the Key Agreement Mechanism 3 (KAM3) defined in Section 6.3 of
<xref target="ISO.11770-4.2006">ISO/IEC 11770-4</xref> with a few modifications/improvements.
However, implementers should use this document as the normative reference, because the algorithm
has been changed in several minor details as well as with major improvements.
</t>

<section title="Support Functions and Notations">

<t>The algorithm definitions use the support functions and notations defined below:</t>

<t>The integers in the specification are in decimal by default, or in hexadecimal when prefixed with "0x".</t>

<t>The functions named octet(), OCTETS(), and INT() are those defined in the <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpauth-mutual">core specification</xref>.</t>

<t>Note:
The definition of OCTETS() is different from the function
GE2OS_x in the original ISO specification, which takes
the shortest representation without preceding zeros.
</t>

<t>All of the algorithms defined in this specification use the default functions defined in the core specification (defined in Section 11 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpauth-mutual" />)
for computing the values pi, &_VK_c; and &_VK_s;.</t>

</section>

<section title="Functions for Discrete Logarithm Settings">

<t>
In this section, an equation (x / y mod z) denotes a natural number w less than z that satisfies
(w * y) mod z = x mod z.
</t>

<t>
For the discrete logarithm, we refer to some of the domain parameters
by using the following symbols:

<list style="symbols">
<t>q: for "the prime" defining the MODP group.</t>
<t>g: for "the generator" associated with the group.</t>
<t>r: for the order of the subgroup generated by g.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
The function J is defined as
</t>

<t>
J(pi) = g^(pi) mod q.
</t>

<t>
The value of &_K_c1; is derived as 
</t>

<t>
&_K_c1; = g^(&_S_c1;) mod q,
</t>

<t>
where &_S_c1; is a random integer within range [1, r&minus;1]
and r is the size of the subgroup generated by g.
In addition, &_S_c1; &MUST; be larger than log(q)/log(g) 
(so that g^(&_S_c1;) > q).
</t>

<t>
The server &MUST; check the condition 1 &lt; &_K_c1; &lt; q&minus;1 upon reception.
</t>

<t>
Let an intermediate value t_1 be
</t>

<t>
t_1 = INT(H(octet(1) | OCTETS(&_K_c1;))),
</t>

<t>
the value of &_K_s1; is derived from J(pi) and &_K_c1; as:
</t>

<t>
&_K_s1; = (J(pi) * &_K_c1;^(t_1))^(&_S_s1;) mod q
</t>

<t>
where &_S_s1; is a random number within range [1, r&minus;1].
The value of &_K_s1; &MUST; satisfy 1 &lt; &_K_s1; &lt; q&minus;1.
If this condition is not held, the server &MUST; reject the exchange.
The client &MUST; check this condition upon reception.
</t>

<t>
Let an intermediate value t_2 be
</t>

<t>
t_2 = INT(H(octet(2) | OCTETS(&_K_c1;) | OCTETS(&_K_s1;))),
</t>

<t>
the value z on the client side is derived by the following equation:
</t>

<t>
z = &_K_s1;^((&_S_c1; + t_2) / (&_S_c1; * t_1 + pi) mod r) mod q.
</t>

<t>
The value z on the server side is derived by the following equation:
</t>

<t>
z = (&_K_c1; * g^(t_2))^(&_S_s1;) mod q.
</t>

<t>
(Note: the original ISO specification contained a message pair
containing verification of value z along with the "transcript" of the
protocol exchange.  This functionality is contained in the
functions &_VK_c; and &_VK_s;.)</t>
</section>

<section title="Functions for Elliptic-Curve Settings">

<t>
For the elliptic-curve setting, we refer to some of the domain parameters
by the following symbols:

<list style="symbols">
<t>q: for the prime used to define the group.</t>
<t>G: for the point defined with the underlying group called "the generator".</t>
<t>h: for the cofactor of the group.</t>
<t>r: for the order of the subgroup generated by G.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
The function P(p) converts a curve point p into an integer representing point p,
by computing x * 2 + (y mod 2), where (x, y) are the coordinates of point p.
P'(z) is the inverse of function P, that is, it converts an integer z
to a point p that satisfies P(p) = z.  If such p exists, it is
uniquely defined.  Otherwise, z does not represent a valid curve point.
</t>
<t>
The operator + indicates the elliptic-curve group operation, and
the operation [x] * p denotes an integer-multiplication of point p:
it calculates p + p + ... (x times) ... + p.
See the literature on elliptic-curve cryptography for the exact algorithms used for those functions
(e.g. Section 3 of <xref target="RFC6090" />, which uses different notations, though).
0_E represents the infinity point.
The equation (x / y mod z) denotes a natural number w less than z that satisfies
(w * y) mod z = x mod z.
</t>

<t>
The function J is defined as
</t>

<t>
J(pi) = [pi] * G.
</t>

<t>
The value of &_K_c1; is derived as 
</t>

<t>
&_K_c1; = P(&_K_c1;'), where &_K_c1;' = [&_S_c1;] * G,
</t>

<t>
where &_S_c1; is a random number within range [1, r&minus;1].
The server &MUST; check that the value of received &_K_c1; represents a valid curve point, and
[h] * &_K_c1;' is not equal to 0_E.
</t>

<t>
Let an intermediate integer t_1 be
</t>

<t>
t_1 = INT(H(octet(1) | OCTETS(&_K_c1;))),
</t>

<t>
the value of &_K_s1; is derived from J(pi) and &_K_c1;' = P'(&_K_c1;) as:
</t>

<t>
&_K_s1; = P([&_S_s1;] * (J(pi) + [t_1] * &_K_c1;')),
</t>

<t>
where &_S_s1; is a random number within range [1, r&minus;1].
The value of &_K_s1; &MUST; represent a valid curve point and 
satisfy [h] * P'(&_K_s1;) &lt;&gt; 0_E.
If this condition is not satisfied, the server &MUST; reject the exchange.
The client &MUST; check this condition upon reception.
</t>

<t>
Let an intermediate integer t_2 be
</t>

<t>
t_2 = INT(H(octet(2) | OCTETS(&_K_c1;) | OCTETS(&_K_s1;))),
</t>

<t>
the value z on the client side is derived by the following equation:
</t>

<t>
z = P([(&_S_c1; + t_2) / (&_S_c1; * t_1 + pi) mod r] * P'(&_K_s1;)).
</t>

<t>
The value z on the server side is derived by the following equation:
</t>

<t>
z = P([&_S_s1;] * (P'(&_K_c1;) + [t_2] * G)).
</t>

<t>
handling of an invalid &_K_s1; value in the exchange has been changed from the original ISO specification.
The original specifies that the sender should retry with another random &_S_s1; value, 
while we specify that the exchange must be rejected.
This is due to an observation that this condition is less likely to result from the random error caused by an unlucky choice of &_S_s1;,
but more likely the result of a systematic failure from an invalid J(pi) value (even implying possible denial-of-service attacks).
</t>
<t>
The usual construction of authenticated key exchange
algorithms consists of a key exchange phase and a
key verification phase.  The latter usually involves
some kinds of exchange transaction to be verified, to avoid
security risks or vulnerabilities caused by mixing values from 
from two or more key exchanges.
In the design of the algorithms in this document,
such a functionality is defined in a generalized manner
in the core specification <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpauth-mutual" />
(see definitions of &_VK_c; and &_VK_s;).
If the algorithm defined above is used in other protocols,
this aspect &MUST; be given careful consideration.
</t>
<t>
The domain parameters chosen and specified in this draft are based on a few assumptions.
In the discrete-logarithm setting, q has to be a safe prime ([(q - 1) / 2] must also be prime), and r should be the largest possible value [(q - 1) / 2].
In the elliptic-curve setting, r has to be prime.
Defining a variation of this algorithm using a different domain parameter &SHOULD; be attentive to these conditions.
